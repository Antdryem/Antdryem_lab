Antdryem-lab

This repository is a personal laboratory for technical and conceptual exploration.

It contains small, independent experiments designed to probe ideas around systems, behavior, simulation, and interactive processes. Each experiment stands on its own and may remain unfinished by design.

The focus is not on polished outcomes, but on process: decisions made, constraints encountered, and limits discovered along the way.

The laboratory evolves incrementally. At any point, the current state is a valid snapshot of ongoing thought and exploration.
