Apologies for the inactivity over the past days. I ran into issues with OpenAI API payments, which temporarily blocked further experimentation and updates.

Activity resumes today. The interruption is noted as an external dependency failure, not a loss of continuity in intent.

First concrete experiment added: an integration that consumes an LLM API locally, using real-world data as input.

The experiment fetches trending news, structures it, and passes it to a language model for lightweight analysis. The goal is not accuracy or polish, but validating an end-to-end loop: data acquisition → prompt construction → model response.

This experiment currently has no audience and no deployment target. Its purpose is purely exploratory and belongs here as a systems probe.

The laboratory continues as planned. Daily updates will resume, even when progress is limited to text-based state tracking rather than code.
