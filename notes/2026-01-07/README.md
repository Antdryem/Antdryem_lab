Setting up and running LLM calls from a Jupyter notebook

Using environment variables to load API keys securely

Making my first API call to an OpenAI model

Understanding and using system vs user prompts

Building a simple website summarizer with an LLM

Changing behavior and tone via system prompts

Rebuilding an LLM task from scratch as an exercise

LLMs are controlled more by prompt structure than by code complexity

System prompts define behavior; user prompts provide input

Rebuilding from scratch reveals real understanding

Small prompt changes can completely change output style

This same pattern scales to real business use cases
