 This laboratory is created as a space for ongoing technical exploration, not as a showcase of finished work.

Only artifacts that take some form—code, structure, or executable behavior—belong here. Ideas without materialization stay outside.

Experiments may be incomplete, unstable, or inefficient, as long as their intent is legible.

Errors and failures are treated as part of the experiment, not as defects to hide.

Inflated work done for appearance, or code without a clear intention, does not belong here.

The laboratory prioritizes internal learning and understanding over external validation.

Open tension: how to preserve this focus as the repository grows and becomes more visible.
