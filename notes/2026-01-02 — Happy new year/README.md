Happy new year, 2026. This laboratory continues as a long-term personal project, intended to grow over time without a fixed endpoint.

The lab is not tied to short-term outcomes. Its value is cumulative and emerges through sustained exploration and iteration.

I am starting to actively engage with the data science community, including platforms such as Kaggle and DataTalks, with the goal of immersion rather than immediate contribution.

Despite having over a decade of professional experience, I have largely remained outside public technical communities. This is a deliberate shift away from isolation and toward industry-level context.

The long-term intent is to reach the same depth of expertise in data science as in full-stack development, across multiple technologies.

This repository will receive daily updates. Some days will include code or experiments; others may consist only of short textual notes documenting state, direction, or reflection.
