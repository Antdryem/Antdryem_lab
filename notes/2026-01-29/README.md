# Repository Status  

This repository has not been updated recently.  
That is intentional and acknowledged.

Over the past months, I have been involved in another project that became a
priority: **supporting Christian schools and communities** by helping them
understand and adopt artificial intelligence in a practical and responsible way.

### Current Focus

The work centers on:

- AI literacy for non-technical audiences  
- Practical training and workshops  
- Helping Christian schools and communities use AI without hype, dependency,
  or blind automation  

This initiative is currently my main focus. I believe it has the potential to
grow and generate meaningful, long-term impact.

### Repository Status

This repository remains relevant and active in intent.  
Updates will continue as time and priorities allow.

Thank you for your patience.
