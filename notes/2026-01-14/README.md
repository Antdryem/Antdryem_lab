Continued hands-on work in the lab, focusing on understanding frontier LLM behavior and evaluation patterns

Compared model capabilities, reasoning modes, and failure cases through practical examples

Reinforced the difference between model intelligence and product-level tooling (agents, deep research, UI features)

Strong LLM engineering is less about picking “the best model” and more about supervision, task alignment, and knowing when reasoning or tools are actually needed

Finalize and push a commit related to my personal portfolio

Keep iterating on lab experiments while documenting decisions and observations more explicitly

Note: I’m still actively working on the lab and will share a commit soon with updates to my personal portfolio
