Setting up the development environment for the LLM course (Cursor + extensions).

Installing Python and Jupyter extensions and selecting the correct kernel.

Understanding how the course uses Jupyter notebooks as labs.

Reviewing the first practical project: scraping a webpage and summarizing it with an LLM.

A correct environment setup is essential before any real LLM work.

Learning happens by modifying and experimenting, not by typing everything from scratch.

Start with simple projects; complexity will come later.

Notebooks are tools for exploration, not final products.

Run the first notebook end-to-end without errors.

Modify small parts of the code to understand how it behaves.

Add simple print/debug statements to observe the flow.

Begin treating the notebook as a base for my own variations.
